 developing a website that seamlessly integrates with LinkedIn
 using webhooks to automate the process of finding and updating 
 internship listings. The system will continuously pull relevant 
 software engineering (SWE) internships—or any selected keyword-based 
 opportunities—directly from LinkedIn’s backend. By leveraging web scraping 
 and API interactions, the platform will ensure real-time updates, keeping 
 the listings fresh and accurate. Additionally, users will receive instant 
 notifications about new opportunities that match their preferences, making
 the internship search process more efficient and hassle-free.
